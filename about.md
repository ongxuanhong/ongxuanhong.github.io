Hello, I am Hong, a Master's graduate from JAIST – School of Information Science (Dec 2015). I created blog about Machine Learning with the aim of contributing a little effort to the Vietnamese Computer Science community as well as helping everyone quickly and easily approach this field to solve the complex problems we are facing today. You can find the link here: [Machine Learning Blog](https://ongxuanhong.wordpress.com/)

Surely, when we search for the keyword "Machine Learning," there are many results including documents, courses, blogs, and software for us to explore. Typically, we will read through all these sources hoping to grasp the concepts as quickly as possible. However, this requires a lot of time and effort, and it’s important to have a guide to get started. Instead, this blog aims to guide everyone towards a thorough understanding of the field of Machine Learning, both in working skills and knowledge, to feel less "overwhelmed" by the vast amount of information available on the Internet.

Through practical examples and specific programming languages, we will take on the role of a data scientist. We focus more on solving problems rather than spending a lot of time delving into the theory of algorithms (that said, you will still need to refer back to documentation for model hyperparameter tuning). These algorithms are often available in pre-installed libraries and optimized for specific models. We shouldn't spend too much time “reinventing the wheel,” which can lead to frustration and abandoning our initial goals.

Additionally, I also share my experiences in studying, working, and researching for beginners in this field to refer to and better orient their future careers.

I hope that what I provide in the blog will be helpful to everyone in their studies, work, and will increase their passion for Machine Learning. For any questions, you can contact me directly via the form on the sidebar on the right or comment below for others interested to reference.
