Hello, I am Hong, a Master's graduate from JAIST â€“ School of Information Science (Dec 2015). I created blog about Machine Learning with the aim of contributing a little effort to the Vietnamese Computer Science community as well as helping everyone quickly and easily approach this field to solve the complex problems we are facing today. You can find the link here: [Machine Learning Blog](https://ongxuanhong.wordpress.com/)

I hope that what I provide in the blog will be helpful to everyone in their studies, work, and will increase their passion for Machine Learning. For any questions, you can contact me directly via the form on the sidebar on the right or comment below for others interested to reference.
